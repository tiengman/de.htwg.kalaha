# de.htwg.kalaha - Kalaha

This project is part of the lecture "Software Engineering" at the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany.

It was important to implement a MVC structure for an easy integration of a GUI at the end of the project. Developing only with a TUI was essential. Several patterns like the observer pattern had to be included.
We had to use test-driven-development by using the JUnit framework and metric checks with sonar.
